# Unacademy OTP Forwarder 
## Why ?
  
Me & my Bois purchased Unacademy subscription together (Poor AF 🥺) .
**The problem** was: My mobile number was registered, so whenever my bois tried to login I had to tell them the OTP I received even if I'm in **Space**.  
I'm a programmer & *"programmers are lazy"*, this was interrupting my laziness.  
So I opened the lid of my Lappy, Slapped some keys and made this **"Awesome"** 🤩 Android App.  
This App will sit back in my phone, eat some battery🔋 & spy🕵️ on incoming SMS messages. *(Don't worry programmers don't have girlfriends)*. If a SMS contains the words "Unacademy" & "OTP" the SMS will be automatically forwarded to my bois.  
Now I can enjoy **TMKOC** without interruptions.
